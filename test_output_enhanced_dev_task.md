## 1. Overview
### 1.1. Brief Description
Create a comprehensive user authentication system with login, registration, and password reset functionality.

### 1.2. Functional Requirements
The enhanced system must:
- The system must process 10,000 records per minute with 99.9% accuracy (verifiable through automated testing)
- The system must validate input data against JSON Schema v7 before processing
- The system must handle invalid input, network failures, and timeout conditions gracefully with appropriate error messages (verifiable through automated testing)

### 1.3. Purpose & Benefits
This task will provide significant value by:
- Improving system functionality and user experience
- Enhancing maintainability and code quality
- Reducing technical debt and future maintenance costs
