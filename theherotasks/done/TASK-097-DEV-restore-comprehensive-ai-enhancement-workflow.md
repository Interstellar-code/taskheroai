### 1.2. Functional Requirements
- The system must implement a detailed step-by-step AI enhancement process with clear progress indicators
- The system must display real-time progress for each AI enhancement step (description, requirements, implementation, risks, visuals, etc.)
- The system must generate comprehensive visual elements including Mermaid diagrams and ASCII art
- The system must create flow diagrams with proper visualization
- The system must perform template structure optimization with feedback
- The system must calculate and display accurate quality scores throughout the process
- The system must provide detailed progress feedback with emojis and status messages
- The system must handle errors gracefully during each enhancement step

### 1.3. Purpose & Benefits
This task will restore the comprehensive AI enhancement workflow that provides users with detailed feedback about the AI processing steps, ensuring transparency and quality in task generation while maintaining the high-quality output standards.

## 2. Detailed Description

The current AI enhancement workflow in `_progressive_step_3_ai_enhancement` is incomplete and lacks the detailed step-by-step process that was previously implemented. The original workflow included:

**Missing Components:**
1. **Detailed Progress Indicators** - Step-by-step progress with emojis and status messages
2. **AI Provider Initialization Feedback** - Clear indication of AI provider readiness
3. **Individual Enhancement Steps** - Separate progress for each AI enhancement component
4. **Visual Elements Generation** - Mermaid diagrams and ASCII art creation
5. **Flow Diagram Creation** - Dedicated flow diagram generation step
6. **Template Structure Optimization** - Template optimization with feedback
7. **Quality Score Calculation** - Real-time quality scoring and display
8. **Comprehensive Error Handling** - Graceful error handling for each step

**Current Issues:**
- The current implementation only shows "ü§ñ Applying AI enhancement..." without detailed steps
- No progress indicators for individual enhancement components
- Missing visual elements generation (Mermaid diagrams, ASCII art)
- No flow diagram creation step
- No template optimization feedback
- Quality scoring is not displayed during the process
- Limited error handling and user feedback

**Expected Workflow (from original implementation):**

## 3. Technical Considerations

### 3.1. Architecture & Design
- **Modular Enhancement Steps**: Each AI enhancement component should be a separate, trackable step
- **Progress Tracking System**: Implement a progress tracking system that can report on individual steps
- **Error Recovery**: Each step should have proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **Quality Metrics**: Implement real-time quality scoring and feedback

### 3.2. Implementation Strategy
- **Step-by-Step Processing**: Break down the AI enhancement into discrete, trackable steps
- **Progress Indicators**: Use consistent emoji and status message patterns
- **Visual Generation**: Implement dedicated visual elements generation (Mermaid, ASCII)
- **Template Optimization**: Add template structure optimization with feedback

### 3.3. Integration Points
- **AI Enhancement Service**: Extend the existing AI enhancement service with progress tracking
- **Template Manager**: Integrate with template manager for optimization feedback
- **Quality Validator**: Use quality validator for real-time scoring
- **Visual Generators**: Implement or restore visual elements generation
