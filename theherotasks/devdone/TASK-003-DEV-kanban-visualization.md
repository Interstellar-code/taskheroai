# Task: TASK-003 - Implement Kanban Board Visualization

## Metadata
- **Created:** 2025-01-27
- **Due:** 2025-02-02
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Status:** Todo
- **Assigned to:** Developer
- **Task Type:** Development
- **Sequence:** 3
- **Tags:** visualization, kanban, ui, terminal, rich

## Overview
Create a visual Kanban board system that displays tasks in Todo, InProgress, and Done columns with proper formatting and status indicators. This will provide users with an intuitive visual interface for managing their project tasks within the terminal environment.

## Implementation Status
| Step | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Design kanban layout | Pending | Plan column structure and sizing |
| Implement terminal visualization | Pending | Use rich library for formatting |
| Add task cards rendering | Pending | Design card layout and content |
| Create status indicators | Pending | Color coding and symbols |
| Add interactive navigation | Pending | Keyboard shortcuts and selection |

## Detailed Description
Build a terminal-based Kanban board visualization that shows:
- Three main columns: Todo, InProgress, Done
- Task cards with essential metadata (ID, title, priority, due date, assignee)
- Color coding for priorities (High=Red, Medium=Yellow, Low=Green) and task types
- Interactive navigation between tasks and columns
- Real-time status updates when tasks change
- Responsive design that adapts to different terminal sizes
- Search and filter capabilities within the board view

Features to include:
- Scrollable columns for large numbers of tasks
- Task detail popup/overlay for full information
- Quick actions (move task, edit status, mark complete)
- Statistics summary (task counts, completion rates)
- Export capabilities for reporting

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Kanban board displays in terminal with proper formatting and alignment
- [ ] Tasks show in correct columns based on their current status
- [ ] Task cards display essential metadata in readable format
- [ ] Color coding implemented for priorities and task types
- [ ] Interactive navigation works properly with keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Board updates in real-time when tasks change status
- [ ] Responsive design works on different terminal sizes
- [ ] Search and filter functionality integrated
- [ ] Performance optimized for large numbers of tasks
- [ ] Error handling for edge cases (empty columns, malformed tasks)

## Implementation Steps
1. Design terminal-based layout system using rich library
2. Create task card rendering functions with metadata display
3. Implement three-column organization with proper spacing
4. Add color coding and styling for priorities and types
5. Build interactive navigation with keyboard shortcuts
6. Add real-time update capabilities
7. Implement search and filter functionality
8. Create responsive design for different screen sizes
9. Add task detail view and quick actions
10. Optimize performance for large datasets

## Dependencies
### Required By This Task
- TASK-002 - Develop Core Task Management Module - Todo

### Dependent On This Task
- None

## Testing Strategy
- Visual testing of board layout across different terminal sizes
- Test with various numbers of tasks (empty, few, many)
- Verify color coding and formatting consistency
- Test interactive features and keyboard navigation
- Performance testing with large task datasets
- Cross-platform terminal compatibility testing

## Technical Considerations
- Use rich library for advanced terminal formatting and colors
- Implement responsive design for different terminal sizes
- Consider performance with large numbers of tasks (virtualization)
- Handle Unicode and special characters properly
- Ensure proper keyboard input handling
- Design for accessibility (screen readers, high contrast)
- Consider memory usage with large task lists

## Database Changes
No database changes required - reads from existing task files.

## Time Tracking
- **Estimated hours:** 12
- **Actual hours:** TBD
