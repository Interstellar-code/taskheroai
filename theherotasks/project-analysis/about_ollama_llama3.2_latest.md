## 5. How TaskHero AI Works
TaskHero AI is a intelligent project management system that allows users to:
1. **Smart Task Assignment through Contextual Analysis**: TaskHero AI employs advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to analyze the context of tasks, team members' expertise, and project timelines. By understanding the nuances in task descriptions, it can intelligently assign tasks based on the most relevant skills and availability. This ensures that each task is taken up by the best-suited team member, improving efficiency and reducing the need for manual intervention.
2. **Predictive Task Prioritization**: Using predictive analytics, TaskHero AI can forecast the potential impact of tasks on project outcomes. By analyzing historical data, current project status, and user behavior, it prioritizes tasks that are likely to have the most significant impact or risk. This helps teams focus their efforts where they matter most, ensuring critical milestones are met without overburdening team members.
3. **Automated Workload Balancing**: TaskHero AI continuously monitors the workload distribution among team members and automatically redistributes tasks to maintain balance. By leveraging real-time data on task progress, availability, and historical productivity patterns, it ensures that no single member is overwhelmed while others are idle. This dynamic balancing prevents burnout and optimizes overall team performance.
4. **Adaptive Schedule Optimization**: This feature utilizes advanced optimization algorithms to dynamically adjust schedules based on the evolving needs of projects and teams. By analyzing project timelines, dependencies, and resource availability, TaskHero AI can suggest the most efficient schedule changes that minimize delays and maximize productivity. It also predicts potential bottlenecks and alerts stakeholders in advance, allowing for proactive mitigation strategies.

Built with modular architecture. Dependencies include: annotated-types, anthropic, anyio, beautifulsoup4, cachetools. Total project files: 1267.

## 6. User Experience Goals
