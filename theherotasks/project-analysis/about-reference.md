## 1. Why TaskHero AI Exists
TaskHero AI was created to solve inefficient project management and task tracking in software development in software development and project management. As development teams, project managers, and software engineers experience scattered task information, manual status updates, lack of intelligent automation, and poor project visibility, teams struggle to maintain visibility and efficiency in complex projects while managing multiple priorities. TaskHero AI provides an AI-powered task management and project analysis platform where users can automate task creation and tracking with AI, provide intelligent insights and project analytics, and streamline team collaboration and workflow optimization.

## 2. Vision Statement
To revolutionize project management by making AI-powered automation accessible to every development team, enabling them to focus on creating great products rather than managing processes.

## 3. Problems Solved
1. **Task Management Inefficiency**: Manual task creation and tracking leads to inconsistencies, missed deadlines, and lost productivity
2. **Poor Project Visibility**: Teams lack real-time insights into project progress, bottlenecks, and resource allocation
3. **Context Switching Overhead**: Developers lose focus and productivity when switching between different tools and interfaces
4. **Inconsistent Documentation**: Project documentation becomes outdated and fragmented across multiple platforms
5. **Knowledge Silos**: Important project knowledge gets trapped with individual team members

## 5. How TaskHero AI Works
TaskHero AI is a intelligent project management system that allows users to:
1. **AI-Powered Task Creation**: Automatically generate detailed, actionable tasks from high-level requirements using advanced AI analysis
2. **Intelligent Project Analysis**: Analyze codebase structure and project patterns to provide contextual insights and recommendations
3. **Automated Workflow Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with existing development tools and Git workflows for minimal disruption
4. **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Monitor project progress with intelligent metrics and automated status updates

Built with The project follows a modular architecture. The primary components are: a setup script (Bash) that orchestrates the entire process, a core application (Flask) that represents the TaskHero AI application, and a virtual environment to isolate dependencies. The setup script manages the creation and activation of the virtual environment, installs the required Python packages, and then executes the core application. architecture. Complexity level: Intermediate - Requires familiarity with Python, Bash scripting, virtual environments, and potentially Flask web development.. The project's key innovation is the automated setup wizard, which simplifies the initial configuration process and ensures a consistent development environment. The use of colorized terminal output enhances the user experience during setup.

## 6. User Experience Goals
1. **Minimal Learning Curve**: Developers can start using the system immediately without extensive training
2. **Context-Aware Interface**: UI adapts to current project context and user workflow patterns
3. **Intelligent Automation**: System handles routine tasks automatically while keeping users informed
4. **Unified Workspace**: Single interface for all project management and development activities

## 7. Target Users
1. **Senior Developer/Tech Lead**: Experienced developers who need to manage complex projects and coordinate team efforts while maintaining code quality
2. **Project Manager**: Non-technical project managers who need clear visibility into development progress and team productivity
3. **Solo Developer/Freelancer**: Independent developers working on multiple projects who need efficient task management and project organization
4. **Development Team Lead**: Team leaders who balance hands-on coding with team management and project coordination responsibilities

## 8. Key User Journeys
