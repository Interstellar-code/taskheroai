## 1. Overview
### 1.1. Brief Description
Create a visual Kanban board system that displays tasks in Todo, InProgress, and Done columns with proper formatting and status indicators. This will provide users with an intuitive visual interface for managing their project tasks within the terminal environment.

### 1.2. Functional Requirements
- The system must the system shall display a kanban board with three distinct columns: todo, inprogress, and done, to represent task status.
- The system must the system shall utilize lucide icons to visually represent task status within each column (e.g., a checkmark for 'done', a circular arrow for 'inprogress', and a simple square for 'todo').
- The system must the system shall allow users to interact with the kanban board via terminal commands to move tasks between columns, reflecting changes in task status.
- The system must the system shall provide clear formatting for each task item on the kanban board, including task titles and potentially brief descriptions, displayed within the terminal environment.
- The system must the system shall implement efficient data structures and algorithms to manage task states and ensure responsive updates to the kanban board display, minimizing screen redraws.

## 6. Risk Assessment
### 6.1. Potential Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Utilizing Lucide icons effectively to represent task states. | Medium | Medium | Conduct thorough stakeholder interviews with key users to clearly define UI expectations – including preferred color schemes, font sizes, spacing, and overall layout. Create low-fidelity wireframes and prototypes to validate design choices early on, specifically focusing on icon selection and clarity within the terminal environment. |
| Potential performance issues with rendering a visual board within a terminal application. | High | Medium | Early and frequent integration testing is crucial. Utilize a test terminal environment that mirrors the production environment as closely as possible.  Document all API interactions and dependencies.  Adhere to established coding standards and best practices for terminal-based applications.  Implement efficient data structures and algorithms for managing task states. Optimize rendering performance by minimizing screen updates and using techniques like cursor positioning instead of full screen redraws. Conduct load testing to identify performance bottlenecks. |
| Dependency on a specific terminal library with potential maintenance challenges. | Medium | Low | Implement efficient data structures and algorithms for managing task states. Optimize rendering performance by minimizing screen updates and using techniques like cursor positioning instead of full screen redraws. Conduct load testing to identify performance bottlenecks. Carefully evaluate and select well-maintained, reputable terminal libraries. Establish a process for monitoring library updates and security vulnerabilities. Consider using a dependency management tool to manage library versions. |
## Testing
Testing will be handled in a separate task based on this task summary and requirements.
## Technical Considerations
- Code modularity and reusability – designing the Kanban board components for potential reuse in other terminal applications.
- Performance optimization – focusing on minimizing terminal resource usage.
- Error handling and logging – robust error handling to gracefully manage unexpected terminal events.
- Testing and validation – comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure the Kanban board’s functionality and stability.
