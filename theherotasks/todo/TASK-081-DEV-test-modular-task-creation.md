## 1. Overview
### 1.1. Brief Description
Test the modular AI task creation system with Graphiti integration

### 1.2. Functional Requirements
- The system must validate user input within 50ms of receiving it, rejecting any input exceeding 256 characters in length.
- The script must create timestamped backup files every hour and verify their integrity before making changes to the main dataset.
- The system must provide specific error messages with error codes (e.g., ERR-001 for invalid input, ERR-002 for file not found) for each failure type, displaying them to the user within 500ms of the error occurring.
- The script must process files in batches of exactly 49 items, displaying a progress percentage every 20% of processing complete.
- The system must maintain an average uptime of at least 99.9% during normal operations, logging any downtime events and their duration to the console within 1s of the event occurring.
- The script must perform a full system backup every 4 hours, verifying its integrity before continuing with the next task.
- The system must provide a visual progress bar displaying the current percentage complete for any ongoing tasks, updating every 20% of progress complete.
- The script must display a warning message to the user if any critical errors occur during task execution, providing them with details of the error and suggestions for resolving it within 10s of the error occurring.

### 1.3. Purpose & Benefits
This task enhances the TaskHero AI system by implementing test modular task creation.

### 1.4. Success Criteria
- [ ] All functional requirements are implemented
- [ ] Code passes all tests and quality checks
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate


## 3. Implementation Status

### 3.1. Implementation Steps
Implementation steps will be defined during planning phase.
## 4. Detailed Description
Test the modular AI task creation system with Graphiti integration



## 6. Risk Assessment
### 6.1. Potential Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Technical complexity higher than estimated | Medium | Low | Break down into smaller tasks, seek technical review |
| Dependencies not available on time | High | Medium | Identify alternative approaches, communicate early with dependencies |





## Testing
Testing will be handled in a separate task based on this task summary and requirements.



## Technical Considerations
- Code modularity and reusability
- Performance optimization
- Error handling and logging
- Testing and validation
