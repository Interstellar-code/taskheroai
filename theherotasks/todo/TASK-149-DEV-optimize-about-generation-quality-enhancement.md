**Task ID:** TASK-149
**Type:** DEV
**Priority:** HIGH
**Status:** TODO
**Created:** 2025-05-30
**Estimated Effort:** 8-12 hours

## 📋 **Task Overview**

Enhance the dynamic about.md generation feature to provide significantly better quality and consistency using the existing AI infrastructure by optimizing context discovery, prompt engineering, and content validation. This builds upon the successful TASK-125 chat optimization approach to establish a robust foundation for about document generation.

## 🎯 **Objectives**

### Primary Goals
1. **Improve Content Quality** - Enhance the relevance and specificity of generated about document content
2. **Optimize Prompt Engineering** - Create more effective prompts that guide AI to better, project-specific responses
3. **Enhance Context Discovery** - Ensure AI finds and uses more relevant project information from the indexed codebase
4. **Increase Content Consistency** - Achieve consistent quality across different AI providers and models

### Success Metrics
- **Content Quality**: Achieve 80%+ quality scores consistently across all AI providers
- **Similarity Score**: Maintain 85%+ similarity to reference about documents
- **Placeholder Elimination**: Reduce placeholder content to <5 instances per document
