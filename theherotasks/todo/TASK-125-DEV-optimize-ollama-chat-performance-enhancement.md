# TASK-125-DEV: Optimize Ollama Chat Performance Enhancement

**Task ID:** TASK-125
**Type:** DEV
**Priority:** HIGH
**Status:** TODO
**Created:** 2025-05-30
**Estimated Effort:** 8-12 hours

## üìã **Task Overview**

Enhance the "Chat with Code" feature to provide significantly better responses using the existing Ollama AI model by optimizing context retrieval, prompt engineering, and response processing. This will establish a strong foundation that will amplify results when using external AI providers.

## üéØ **Objectives**

### Primary Goals
1. **Improve Context Quality** - Enhance the relevance and depth of codebase context provided to AI
2. **Optimize Prompt Engineering** - Create more effective prompts that guide Ollama to better responses
3. **Enhance Response Processing** - Improve how responses are formatted and presented to users
4. **Increase Context Discovery** - Ensure AI finds and uses more relevant files from the indexed codebase

### Success Metrics
- **Context Relevance**: Increase relevant files found from ~9 to 15-20 files
- **Response Quality**: Achieve more detailed, actionable responses similar to external analysis
- **User Satisfaction**: Responses should provide specific functionality insights, not generic overviews
- **Performance**: Maintain or improve response time while increasing quality

## üîç **Problem Analysis**

### Current Issues Identified
1. **Limited Context Discovery**: Only finding 9 files when 300+ are indexed
2. **Generic Responses**: AI provides surface-level analysis instead of detailed functionality insights
3. **Poor Prompt Engineering**: Prompts don't guide Ollama to provide comprehensive analysis
4. **Insufficient Context Formatting**: Context isn't optimally structured for AI consumption
5. **Missing Semantic Enhancement**: Not leveraging file descriptions and metadata effectively

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Implementation Plan**

### Phase 1: Context Discovery Enhancement (3-4 hours)

#### 1.1 Improve File Selection Algorithm
**File:** `mods/ai/context_manager.py`

**Changes:**
- Enhance `_enhanced_file_selection()` to use semantic similarity more effectively
- Implement multi-pass file discovery (keyword + semantic + metadata)
- Add file importance scoring based on project structure
- Include task files from `/theherotasks` for project context

**Implementation:**
```python
def _multi_pass_file_discovery(self, query: str, max_files: int) -> List[str]:
    """Multi-pass file discovery combining multiple strategies."""
    # Pass 1: Semantic similarity search
    semantic_files = self._semantic_file_search(query, max_files // 2)

    # Pass 2: Enhanced keyword matching with metadata
    keyword_files = self._enhanced_keyword_search(query, max_files // 2)

    # Pass 3: Project structure importance
    important_files = self._get_structurally_important_files(query)

    # Combine and deduplicate
    return self._combine_and_rank_files(semantic_files, keyword_files, important_files, max_files)
```

#### 1.2 Enhanced Metadata Utilization
- Leverage file descriptions from `.index/descriptions/` more effectively
- Include completed task summaries for project understanding
- Add file relationship mapping (imports, dependencies)

### Phase 2: Prompt Engineering Optimization (2-3 hours)

#### 2.1 Create Specialized Prompt Templates
**File:** `mods/ai/providers/ollama_provider.py`

**Changes:**
- Implement role-specific prompts for different query types
- Add structured prompt templates for code analysis
- Include explicit instructions for comprehensive responses

**Implementation:**
```python
def _build_enhanced_prompt(self, query: str, context: str) -> str:
    """Build enhanced prompt with role-specific instructions."""

    # Detect query type
    query_type = self._classify_query_type(query)

    # Select appropriate prompt template
    prompt_template = self._get_prompt_template(query_type)

    # Build structured prompt
    return prompt_template.format(
        context=context,
        query=query,
        instructions=self._get_analysis_instructions(query_type)
    )
```

#### 2.2 Add Analysis Instructions
- Create specific instructions for functional analysis
- Add examples of good vs. poor responses
- Include formatting guidelines for structured output

### Phase 3: Context Formatting Enhancement (2-3 hours)

#### 3.1 Structured Context Presentation
**File:** `mods/ai/context_manager.py`

**Changes:**
- Reorganize context format for better AI comprehension
- Add context hierarchy (core files ‚Üí supporting files ‚Üí documentation)
- Include file relationships and dependencies
- Add project workflow context from task management

**Implementation:**
```python
def format_enhanced_context_for_ai(self, context: CodebaseContext, query: str) -> str:
    """Format context with enhanced structure and hierarchy."""

    formatted_parts = []

    # 1. Project Context & Purpose
    formatted_parts.append(self._format_project_purpose(context))

    # 2. Query-Specific File Hierarchy
    formatted_parts.append(self._format_file_hierarchy(context, query))

    # 3. Core Functionality Analysis
    formatted_parts.append(self._format_core_functionality(context))

    # 4. User Workflow Context
    formatted_parts.append(self._format_user_workflows(context))

    # 5. Code Examples with Explanations
    formatted_parts.append(self._format_code_with_explanations(context))

    return '\n\n'.join(formatted_parts)
```

#### 3.2 Add Task Management Context
- Include relevant completed tasks for project understanding
- Add current project status and goals
- Provide user workflow examples from task descriptions

### Phase 4: Response Processing Enhancement (1-2 hours)

#### 4.1 Response Quality Validation
**File:** `mods/ai/chat_handler.py`

**Changes:**
- Add response quality scoring
- Implement response enhancement for generic answers
- Add follow-up question suggestions

#### 4.2 Response Formatting
- Structure responses with clear sections
- Add actionable insights and examples
- Include relevant file references with explanations
