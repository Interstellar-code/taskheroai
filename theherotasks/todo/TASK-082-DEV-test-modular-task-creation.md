## 1. Overview
### 1.1. Brief Description
Test the modular AI task creation system with Graphiti integration

### 1.2. Functional Requirements
- The system must validate user input within 50ms of receiving it, rejecting inputs exceeding 200 characters.
- The script must create timestamped backup files before making changes and verify backup integrity every hour, with a minimum of 3 successful verifications per day.
- The system must provide specific error messages with error codes (ERR-001 to ERR-999) for each failure type, displaying the error message and code within 2 seconds of the failure occurring.
- The script must process files in batches of 25 items, displaying a progress percentage every 5% of file processing completion.
- The system must maintain 99.95% uptime during normal operations, with a maximum of 15 minutes of downtime per day for maintenance and updates.
- The script must provide detailed logs of all user interactions, including input validations, file processing, and error messages, with a minimum of 30 log entries per day.
- The system must allow for user-defined custom validation rules, with the ability to save and recall these rules for future use.
- The script must provide real-time statistics on file processing speed and memory usage, updating every minute with a maximum update frequency of once every 5 minutes.

### 1.3. Purpose & Benefits
This task enhances the TaskHero AI system by implementing test modular task creation.

### 1.4. Success Criteria
- [ ] All functional requirements are implemented

## 6. Risk Assessment
### 6.1. Potential Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Technical complexity higher than estimated | Medium | Low | Break down into smaller tasks, seek technical review |
| Dependencies not available on time | High | Medium | Identify alternative approaches, communicate early with dependencies |





## Testing
Testing will be handled in a separate task based on this task summary and requirements.



## Technical Considerations
- Code modularity and reusability
- Performance optimization
- Error handling and logging
- Testing and validation
