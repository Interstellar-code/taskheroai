- Weak risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Inconsistent formatting and professional presentation

**Enhanced System Features:**
- Complete section validation ensuring all areas are populated with relevant content
- Context-aware content generation producing task-specific, actionable information
- Professional formatting standards with consistent structure and presentation
- Automated Mermaid diagram generation for process flows and user journeys
