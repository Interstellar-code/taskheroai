## 1. Overview
### 1.1. Brief Description
Enhance the Windows installation script to include user configuration prompts and better error handling

### 1.2. Functional Requirements
Implement test install script enhancement according to specifications
- The script must be updated to prompt the user for configuration details during the installation process.
- The script must validate the user's inputs and deny any invalid entries, providing a clear error message to guide the user towards valid entries.
- The script must include a comprehensive error handling system that catches and logs errors during the installation process.
- The script must provide clear, user-friendly messages for any errors encountered. These messages should include guidance on how to resolve the error.
- The script must be able to run within the existing Windows environment, without requiring any additional software or dependencies.
- The script must be written in a language that is compatible with the existing code base, such as PowerShell or Batch.
- The script must include comments and documentation to enable other developers to understand and modify the code in the future.
- The script must be tested on different versions of Windows to ensure its compatibility and functionality across all supported platforms.

### 1.3. Purpose & Benefits
This task enhances the TaskHero AI system by implementing test install script enhancement.
- Improved Efficiency: Enhanced installation scripts speed up the installation process and reduce the time spent on troubleshooting, which directly increases business productivity.
- Enhanced Error Handling: Better error handling mechanisms in the installation script will help to prevent unexpected crashes, thus improving system stability and reliability.
- Improved User Experience: User configuration prompts will make the installation process more interactive and user-friendly, improving the user experience.
- Strategic Value: The enhancement of the installation script aligns with the long-term strategy of improving product quality and user satisfaction, which could lead to increased customer retention and loyalty.
- Risk Reduction: Enhanced error handling can prevent critical system failures and data loss, thereby reducing operational risks.
- Cost Savings: By reducing the time spent on troubleshooting and the potential for system crashes, the enhanced script could lead to significant cost savings in the long run.

### 1.4. Success Criteria
- [ ] Installation script runs successfully on target platforms
- [ ] User configuration is properly collected and validated
- [ ] Settings are correctly stored in configuration files
- [ ] Application starts successfully after setup

## 3. Implementation Status

### 3.1. Implementation Steps
- [ ] **Step 1: Understanding the Current Script** - Status: ⏳ Pending - Target: 2025-06-01
- [ ] Sub-step 1: Analyze the current Windows installation script in the file .index\descriptions\mods_project_management_planning_todo_TASK-048-DEV-test-enhanced-install-script-task.md.txt. Understand what it does, its flow, and how it handles errors currently.
- [ ] Sub-step 2: Document the existing script's functionality to ensure that no features are lost in the enhancement process.
- [ ] **Step 2: Designing User Configuration Prompts** - Status: ⏳ Pending - Target: 2025-06-01
- [ ] Sub-step 1: Identify the areas in the installation process where user input could be beneficial. This may include paths for installation, optional features to install, or other user-specific configurations.
- [ ] Sub-step 2: Design a set of prompts to gather this information from the user during the installation process. Ensure these prompts are clear, concise, and user-friendly.
- [ ] **Step 3: Implementing User Configuration Prompts** - Status: ⏳ Pending - Target: 2025-06-01
- [ ] Sub-step 1: Implement the designed prompts into the installation script. This might involve using 'read' commands to capture user input, and 'echo' commands to provide the user with information and instructions.
- [ ] Sub-step 2: Test the new prompts to ensure they work as expected.
- [ ] **Step 4: Enhancing Error Handling** - Status: ⏳ Pending - Target: 2025-06-01
- [ ] Sub-step 1: Identify potential points of failure in the installation script where enhanced error handling would be beneficial.
- [ ] Sub-step 2: Implement additional 'try/catch' blocks or conditional statements to catch these errors and provide informative error messages to the user.
- [ ] **Step 5: Testing and Documentation** - Status: ⏳ Pending - Target: 2025-06-01
- [ ] Sub-step 1: Thoroughly test the enhanced script to ensure it works as expected, handles errors appropriately, and properly incorporates user input.
- [ ] Sub-step 2: Update the documentation in the .index\descriptions\mods_project_management_planning_todo_TASK-048-DEV-test-enhanced-install-script-task.md.txt file to reflect the changes and enhancements made to the script. This should include information on new user prompts and improved error handling.
