## Metadata
- **Created:** 2025-01-27
- **Due:** 2025-02-20
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Status:** Todo
- **Assigned to:** Developer
- **Task Type:** Development
- **Sequence:** 10
- **Tags:** deployment, packaging, distribution, setup, installation

## Overview
Create a robust deployment and packaging system for TaskHero AI distribution across different platforms. This system will ensure easy installation and updates for users across Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms.

## Implementation Status
| Step | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Update setup scripts | Pending | Modernize installation process |
| Create installation packages | Pending | Platform-specific packages |
| Build distribution system | Pending | Automated build and release |
| Add update mechanisms | Pending | In-app and manual updates |
| Create deployment documentation | Pending | Installation and setup guides |

## Detailed Description
Develop comprehensive deployment solution including:
- Updated setup scripts for Windows (PowerShell) and Linux/macOS (Bash)
- Package creation for distribution (pip, MSI, deb, rpm packages)
- Automated installation processes with dependency management
- Update and upgrade mechanisms for seamless version transitions
- Deployment documentation and user guides
- Containerization options (Docker) for enterprise deployment
- Virtual environment management and isolation
- Configuration migration tools for existing users
- Rollback capabilities for failed updates

Key features:
- One-click installation experience
- Automatic dependency resolution
- Configuration preservation during updates
- Multiple installation methods (pip, native packages, containers)
- Uninstallation and cleanup tools
- Version checking and update notifications

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Setup scripts updated for TaskHero AI with modern installation process
- [ ] Installation packages created for major platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- [ ] Distribution system functional with automated builds and releases
- [ ] Update mechanisms implemented with proper version management
- [ ] Deployment documentation completed with step-by-step guides
- [ ] Installation process tested and verified on clean systems
- [ ] Dependency management working correctly across platforms
- [ ] Configuration migration tools functional for existing users
- [ ] Rollback capabilities implemented for failed updates
- [ ] Uninstallation process clean and complete

## Implementation Steps
1. Update existing setup scripts for TaskHero AI branding and features
2. Create platform-specific installation packages (MSI, deb, rpm)
3. Implement automated build and distribution system
4. Add update mechanisms with version checking and notifications
5. Test installation processes on clean systems
6. Create comprehensive deployment documentation
7. Verify cross-platform compatibility and dependencies
8. Implement configuration migration for existing users
9. Add rollback and uninstallation capabilities
10. Test complete deployment workflow end-to-end

## Dependencies
### Required By This Task
- TASK-009 - Comprehensive Integration Testing - Todo

### Dependent On This Task
- None

## Testing Strategy
- Test installation on clean systems for all supported platforms
- Verify all dependencies are included and properly installed
- Test update mechanisms with version transitions
- Cross-platform installation testing on multiple environments
- Test configuration migration from existing installations
- Verify uninstallation removes all components cleanly
- Load testing with various system configurations

## Technical Considerations
- Consider using package managers (pip, chocolatey, homebrew, apt)
- Implement proper dependency management and version pinning
- Include proper error handling and logging for installation process
- Consider containerization options (Docker) for complex deployments
- Design for offline installation capabilities
- Implement proper security measures for package verification
- Consider code signing for executable packages

## Database Changes
No database changes required - deployment handles existing file-based storage.

## Time Tracking
- **Estimated hours:** 12
- **Actual hours:** TBD
