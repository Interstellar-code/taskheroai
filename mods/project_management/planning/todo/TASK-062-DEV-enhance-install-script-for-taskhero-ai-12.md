### 1.2. Functional Requirements
['The install script should correctly divide the installation process into two parts: package installation and user configuration.', 'The script should provide clear, user-friendly prompts to guide the user through the configuration process. These prompts should be written in a manner that is easily understandable even to users with minimal technical knowledge.', 'The script should be able to ask the user specific questions about the setup, such as whether this will be a central repository for all code bases, the path of the code base to be indexed, the path of the project tasks files storage, whether taskhero API and MCP functions will be used, and API details for the models and functions required by taskhero.', "The script should be able to store the user's responses to these questions in the app settings JSON file and the API settings into the ENV file accordingly.", 'The script should correctly initiate the run of the app.py file after the configuration process is completed.', 'On subsequent runs, the script should be able to identify and skip any settings that were completed during the initial run, and directly proceed to running the app.', 'The script should include appropriate error handling measures to deal with potential issues that may arise during the installation and configuration process, such as invalid user input or inaccessible file paths.', "The script should be able to function correctly and predictably even in edge cases, such as when the user's responses to the configuration questions are inconsistent or contradict each other."]

## 4. Detailed Description
Task Title: Enhance Install Script for Taskhero AI #12
Task Description:
The main objective of this task is to enhance the existing Windows setup script (setup_windows.bat) that installs and runs the Taskhero AI application. The goal is to make the script more informative for the user, and to divide the script into two main parts: installation and setup, and user configuration.
Technical Context:
The setup_windows.bat file is currently responsible for installing Taskhero AI and initiating the virtual environment to run the application. This script also initiates the running of the app.py file at the end of the process. However, it lacks interactive user input for configuration and informative prompts during the process. It will be necessary to familiarize yourself with the codebase and the existing script to identify the points of enhancement.
Key Implementation Considerations:
1. Installation and Setup: The first part of the script should handle the installation of required packages for the application. This should be done in an organized and systematic manner.
2. User Configuration: The second part should prompt the user with a series of questions to gather information for configuration. These questions should include:
   - Whether the setup will be a central repository for all code bases or singular for the existing code base it is going to index.
   - The path of the code base which Taskhero is going to index.
   - The path for project tasks files storage (default present folder or root folder /taskherofiles).
   - Whether Taskhero API and MCP functions will be used.
   - API details for the models and functions required by Taskhero to function.
3. Settings and Environment Variables: Gathered details should be stored in the app settings JSON file and environment variables file (ENV) accordingly.
4. Script Re-run: Upon re-running the script, all completed settings from the initial run should be skipped, allowing the user to go directly to the application run.
Expected Deliverables:
1. An enhanced setup_windows.bat script that is interactive, informative, and user-friendly.
2. A detailed document explaining the implemented enhancements and user prompts.
Integration Points with Existing System:
The enhanced script should seamlessly integrate with the existing system. It should not disrupt any existing functionality of the application or the setup process. The script should store settings in the existing app settings JSON file and environment variables file (ENV) as per the current system requirement. Also, it should correctly initiate the running of the app.py file just as the existing script does.
Please ensure that the enhanced script is thoroughly tested in different scenarios to confirm that it works as expected and provides a smooth user experience.

- Use `═══` for emphasis/headers
- Use `...` for content areas
- Use `[Button]` for interactive elements
- Use `📊📅💳⚙️` emojis for icons and visual elements
- Use `↕↗▼` arrows for sorting and navigation indicators
- Use `🔴🟢` colored circles for status indicators
- Use `^annotations` below diagrams for explanations

## 6. Risk Assessment
### 6.1. Potential Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Misinterpretation of user inputs during setup | High | Medium | Design the script to validate user inputs before proceeding. Provide clear instructions and examples for each input prompt to minimize user error. |
| Incompatibility with different Windows versions | Medium | Medium | Test the script on a range of Windows versions. Make use of conditional statements to handle version-specific commands or operations. |
| Incorrect handling of existing settings when the script is run for the second time | Medium | Low | Implement a robust system to store and retrieve settings. Ensure the script correctly identifies and skips completed settings. |
| Script failure due to missing or incorrect API details | High | Low | Include error handling and informative error messages in the script. Consider providing a default API setting that can be used if the user's API details are not provided or are incorrect. |
| User errors due to lack of script's output understanding | Low | Medium | Make the script output as informative as possible. Include a help command or document that explains the output and potential error messages. |
