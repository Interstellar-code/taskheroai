- **Due:** 2025-01-29
- **Priority:** High
- **Status:** ✅ Complete - Branding Updated
- **Assigned to:** Developer
- **Task Type:** Development
- **Sequence:** 1
- **Tags:** setup, structure, foundation, integration, taskheroai

## Overview
Establish the new project structure for TaskHero AI by reorganizing the existing codebase and integrating TaskHeroMD components. This foundational task creates the proper directory structure and file organization for the merged system.

## Implementation Status
| Step | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Analyze current structure | ✅ Complete | Examined TaskHero AI and TaskHeroMD components |
| Create new folder structure | ✅ Complete | Created mods/project_management/ module |
| Move core files | ✅ Complete | Core files integrated successfully |
| Integrate TaskHeroMD templates | ✅ Complete | Templates integrated into new structure |
| Update project metadata | ✅ Complete | Updated branding to TaskHero AI |

## Recent Updates
- **2025-01-27 15:30:** Started analysis phase
- **2025-01-27 15:45:** Completed structure analysis, identified clarification needs
- **2025-01-27 15:50:** Requirements clarified, starting implementation:
  - Convert PowerShell scripts to Python modules
  - Add new menu option for project management (skip AI integration for now)
  - Display as TaskHero AI, keep internal structure for compatibility
  - Create mods/project_management/ module structure
  - No backward compatibility concerns for migration
- **2025-05-23:** ✅ Completed branding update from VerbalCodeAI to TaskHero AI

## Detailed Description
Create a new project structure that combines the best of both systems:
- Maintain TaskHero AI's modular `mods/` structure for core functionality
- Add new `project_management/` module for task management features
- Integrate TaskHeroMD's documentation templates and project planning tools
- Update project naming and branding throughout the codebase
- Establish proper Python import paths and module organization
- Create logical separation between AI features and project management features

The new structure should support:
- Seamless integration between AI and project management
- Modular development and testing
- Easy maintenance and future extensions
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] New folder structure created with proper organization
- [x] All TaskHero AI files properly migrated without broken imports
- [x] TaskHeroMD templates integrated into new structure
- [x] Project renamed to TaskHero AI throughout codebase (files, imports, documentation)
- [x] README.md updated with new project information and branding
- [x] All existing TaskHero AI functionality remains intact
- [x] Python import paths updated and tested
- [x] Project metadata files updated (setup scripts, requirements, etc.)

## Implementation Steps
1. ✅ Design and create new project directory structure
2. ✅ Create backup of existing codebase  
3. ✅ Move TaskHero AI core files to new structure maintaining organization
4. ✅ Copy TaskHeroMD templates and documentation to appropriate locations
5. ✅ Update all references from VerbalCodeAI to TaskHero AI in code and documentation
6. ✅ Create new project_management module structure
7. ✅ Update Python import statements throughout codebase
8. ✅ Test that existing functionality still works after reorganization
9. ✅ Update setup scripts and configuration files
10. ✅ Commit new structure to version control

## Dependencies
None (foundational task - all other tasks depend on this)

## Testing Strategy
- Verify all files are properly organized in new structure
- Ensure no broken imports or missing references
- Test that existing TaskHero AI functionality still works after migration
- Validate that all paths are cross-platform compatible
- Check that setup scripts work with new structure

## Technical Considerations
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing configurations where possible
- Ensure proper Python import paths are maintained
- Consider cross-platform file path compatibility
- Preserve existing .env configuration structure
- Maintain compatibility with existing MCP and HTTP API endpoints
- Document any breaking changes for users

## Database Changes
No database changes required for this task.

## Time Tracking
- **Estimated hours:** 8
- **Actual hours:** 8 (completed with branding update)
