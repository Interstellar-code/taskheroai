# Task: TASK-001 - Set Up TaskHeroAI Project Structure

## Metadata
- **Created:** 2025-01-27
- **Due:** 2025-01-29
- **Priority:** High
- **Status:** In Progress - Implementation Started
- **Assigned to:** Developer
- **Task Type:** Development
- **Sequence:** 1
- **Tags:** setup, structure, foundation, integration, taskheroai

## Overview
Establish the new project structure for TaskHeroAI by reorganizing the existing VerbalCodeAI codebase and integrating TaskHeroMD components. This foundational task will create the proper directory structure and file organization for the merged system.

## Implementation Status
| Step | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Analyze current structure | âœ… Complete | Examined VerbalCodeAI and TaskHeroMD components |
| Create new folder structure | ðŸ”„ In Progress | Creating mods/project_management/ module |
| Move VerbalCodeAI files | Pending | Ready to start after structure creation |
| Integrate TaskHeroMD templates | Pending | Templates will be moved to new structure |
| Update project metadata | Pending | Rename displays to TaskHeroAI |

## Recent Updates
- **2025-01-27 15:30:** Started analysis phase
- **2025-01-27 15:45:** Completed structure analysis, identified clarification needs
- **2025-01-27 15:50:** Requirements clarified, starting implementation:
  - Convert PowerShell scripts to Python modules
  - Add new menu option for project management (skip AI integration for now)
  - Display as TaskHeroAI, keep internal structure for compatibility
  - Create mods/project_management/ module structure
  - No backward compatibility concerns for migration

## Detailed Description
Create a new project structure that combines the best of both systems:
- Maintain VerbalCodeAI's modular `mods/` structure for core functionality
- Add new `project_management/` module for task management features
- Integrate TaskHeroMD's documentation templates and project planning tools
- Update project naming and branding throughout the codebase
- Establish proper Python import paths and module organization
- Create logical separation between AI features and project management features

The new structure should support:
- Seamless integration between AI and project management
- Modular development and testing
- Easy maintenance and future extensions
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] New folder structure created with proper organization
- [ ] All VerbalCodeAI files properly migrated without broken imports
- [ ] TaskHeroMD templates integrated into new structure
- [ ] Project renamed to TaskHeroAI throughout codebase (files, imports, documentation)
- [ ] README.md updated with new project information and branding
- [ ] All existing VerbalCodeAI functionality remains intact
- [ ] Python import paths updated and tested
- [ ] Project metadata files updated (setup scripts, requirements, etc.)

## Implementation Steps
1. âœ… Design and create new project directory structure
2. âœ… Create backup of existing VerbalCodeAI codebase  
3. ðŸ”„ Move VerbalCodeAI core files to new structure maintaining organization
4. ðŸ”„ Copy TaskHeroMD templates and documentation to appropriate locations
5. ðŸ”„ Update all references from VerbalCodeAI to TaskHeroAI in code and documentation
6. ðŸ”„ Create new project_management module structure
7. ðŸ”„ Update Python import statements throughout codebase
8. ðŸ”„ Test that existing functionality still works after reorganization
9. ðŸ”„ Update setup scripts and configuration files
10. ðŸ”„ Commit new structure to version control

## Dependencies
None (foundational task - all other tasks depend on this)

## Testing Strategy
- Verify all files are properly organized in new structure
- Ensure no broken imports or missing references
- Test that existing VerbalCodeAI functionality still works after migration
- Validate that all paths are cross-platform compatible
- Check that setup scripts work with new structure

## Technical Considerations
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing configurations where possible
- Ensure proper Python import paths are maintained
- Consider cross-platform file path compatibility
- Preserve existing .env configuration structure
- Maintain compatibility with existing MCP and HTTP API endpoints
- Document any breaking changes for users

## Database Changes
No database changes required for this task.

## Time Tracking
- **Estimated hours:** 8
- **Actual hours:** 1.5 (analysis phase)
