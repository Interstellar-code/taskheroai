['The enhanced script should be able to install all necessary packages to set up the app requirements, with a progress indicator and error handling for any failed installations.', 'The script should prompt the user with a series of questions to define the app configuration, including whether TaskHero AI will be a central repository or singular, the path of the code base to index, the path of the project tasks files storage, and whether TaskHero API and MCP functions will be used.', "The script should be able to save the user's responses to these configuration questions in the app settings JSON file and API settings in the ENV file for future use.", 'The script should initiate the run of the app.py file to run TaskHero AI after configuration is completed.', 'On subsequent runs, the script should check for existing settings and skip the configuration step if already completed, going directly to the app run.', 'The script should handle edge cases such as invalid user inputs during the configuration step, ensuring that the user is prompted again until valid input is provided.', 'The script should be compatible with the existing codebase patterns and not introduce any breaking changes.', 'The script should incorporate proper logging to record the installation and configuration process, aiding in debugging and future enhancements.']

## 4. Detailed Description
**Task Title:** Enhance Install Script for TaskHero AI #5

**Overview and Objectives:** 

The primary goal of this task is to improve the user experience and efficiency of the current setup_windows.bat file that is used to install and run the TaskHero AI application. The aim is to make the script more informative and elegant when executed. The enhanced script is expected to handle installation of packages for app requirements, user interaction to answer configuration questions, storing app settings in a JSON file, and initiating the app.py file.

**Technical Context:**

The setup_windows.bat file is a crucial part of our application's installation process. Our codebase consists of a mix of Python, JSON and Batch Script files. The TaskHero AI app is primarily written in Python and it uses a JSON file for app settings and an ENV file for API settings. The Batch Script is used to setup the Python virtual environment and run the application.

**Key Implementation Considerations:**

1. **Script Division:** The script needs to be divided into two main parts - installation and configuration. The first part will handle the installation of the necessary packages while the second will interact with the user to set up the app requirements.

2. **User Interaction:** The script should prompt users with questions about configuration settings such as whether TaskHero AI would be a central repository for all codebases, the path of the codebase that TaskHero AI will index, the location of project task files, and the usage of TaskHero API and MCP functions. 

3. **Settings Storage:** The setting details provided by the user should be stored in the app settings JSON file and API settings in the ENV file accordingly. 

4. **App Execution:** Upon successful configuration, the script should initiate the app.py file to run the TaskHero AI application. 

5. **Settings Persistence:** If settings have been previously completed, they should be skipped in subsequent runs of the script to go directly to the app run. 

**Expected Deliverables:**

An enhanced windows setup script (setup_windows.bat) that is more user-friendly and efficient, covering all the points detailed above.

**Integration Points with Existing System:**

The enhanced script will interact with the existing taskhero codebase, app settings JSON file and API settings ENV file. It should seamlessly integrate with the existing system, ensuring that it does not disrupt the current functionality while providing an improved user experience. The script should also be able to handle future scaling and expansions of the TaskHero AI application.

## 6. Risk Assessment
### 6.1. Potential Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Incorrect Script Modification | High | Medium | Ensure the modification of the script is done by a skilled developer. Conduct thorough testing in different environments before deployment. |
| User Input Errors | Medium | High | Implement input validation and error handling. Provide clear instructions and examples for the user to follow when providing inputs. |
| Compatibility Issues with Different Operating Systems | Medium | Medium | Test the script on different operating systems. If necessary, create different versions of the script for different operating systems. |
| Data Loss due to Incorrect Storage Path | High | Low | Implement a confirmation step before moving any files. Include a backup feature in the script. |
| Security Vulnerability from Exposure of API Details | High | Low | Implement secure methods for storing and handling sensitive data such as API details. This could involve encryption or using secure environment variables. |
