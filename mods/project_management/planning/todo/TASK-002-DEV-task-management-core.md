# Task: TASK-002 - Develop Core Task Management Module

## Metadata
- **Created:** 2025-01-27
- **Due:** 2025-01-31
- **Priority:** High
- **Status:** Todo
- **Assigned to:** Developer
- **Task Type:** Development
- **Sequence:** 2
- **Tags:** core, task-management, module, python, crud

## Overview
Create the core task management module that handles task creation, status updates, and organization within the Python ecosystem. This module will serve as the foundation for all task management functionality in TaskHeroAI.

## Implementation Status
| Step | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Design task model | Pending | Need to define data structure |
| Implement task CRUD operations | Pending | Create, Read, Update, Delete |
| Create task status management | Pending | Todo → InProgress → Done workflow |
| Add task metadata handling | Pending | Dates, priorities, assignments |
| Implement file-based storage | Pending | Markdown file I/O operations |

## Detailed Description
Develop a Python-based task management system that replicates and enhances TaskHeroMD's functionality:
- Task creation with proper metadata (ID, title, dates, priority, status, assignee, type)
- Status transitions (Todo → InProgress → Done) with validation
- File-based storage using markdown files for compatibility
- Task templates and validation to ensure consistency
- Search and filtering capabilities for task discovery
- Integration points for AI-powered features

The module should be:
- Modular and easily testable
- Compatible with existing TaskHeroMD task structure
- Extensible for future enhancements
- Performance-optimized for large numbers of tasks

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Task model defined with all required fields (ID, title, metadata, content)
- [ ] CRUD operations for tasks implemented and tested
- [ ] Status management system working with proper validation
- [ ] Markdown file I/O operations functional and error-resistant
- [ ] Task validation and templates created with proper schemas
- [ ] Search and filter functionality implemented
- [ ] Unit tests covering all core functionality
- [ ] Integration with project folder structure working
- [ ] Performance tested with realistic task loads

## Implementation Steps
1. Define Task class/dataclass with all metadata fields
2. Implement task creation methods with validation
3. Create status transition logic with business rules
4. Build file I/O operations for markdown reading/writing
5. Add task validation using schemas
6. Implement task templates for consistency
7. Create search and filtering capabilities
8. Add batch operations for multiple tasks
9. Implement task archiving and cleanup
10. Create comprehensive unit tests

## Dependencies
### Required By This Task
- TASK-001 - Set Up TaskHeroAI Project Structure - Todo

### Dependent On This Task
- None

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for Task class and all methods
- Integration tests for file operations
- Test status transitions and validation rules
- Performance testing with large datasets
- Error handling and edge case testing
- Cross-platform file system compatibility tests

## Technical Considerations
- Use Python dataclasses or Pydantic for task models
- Implement proper error handling for file operations
- Consider using pathlib for cross-platform file handling
- Use proper logging for debugging and monitoring
- Implement atomic file operations to prevent corruption
- Consider thread safety for concurrent access
- Design for extensibility and plugin architecture

## Database Changes
No database changes required - using file-based storage for compatibility with TaskHeroMD approach.

## Time Tracking
- **Estimated hours:** 16
- **Actual hours:** TBD
