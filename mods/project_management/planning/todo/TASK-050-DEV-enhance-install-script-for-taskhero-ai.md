Task Description:

This task involves enhancing the existing setup_windows.bat installation script for TaskHero AI. The goal is to improve the user ...

### 1.2. Functional Requirements
["The script must be capable of installing all the necessary packages for setting up the app requirements. This functionality should be tested by verifying the successful installation of the packages and the app's proper functioning after the setup.", "The script should have an interactive interface that prompts the user to answer specific questions about the setup process.

This can be tested by checking the configuration settings after the setup is complete.', 'The script should prompt the user to provide the path of the codebase which taskhero is going to index. This can be tested by verifying if the provided path is correctly set in the configuration.', 'The script should ask the user for the path of the project tasks files storage. It should provide options for a default present folder or a root folder /taskherofiles. This can be tested by verifying if the selected path is correctly set in the configuration.', "The script should query the user if taskhero API and MCP functions will be used. This can be verified by checking if the corresponding settings are enabled or disabled based on the user's response.", 'The script should ask the user for API details required by taskhero to function. This can be tested by verifying if the provided API details are correctly set in the ENV file.', 'The script should store all the user-provided details in the app settings json file and API settings in the ENV file. This can be tested by verifying if the details are correctly stored in the respective files.']

## 4. Detailed Description
Task Title: Enhance Install Script for TaskHero AI

Task Description:

This task involves enhancing the existing setup_windows.bat installation script for TaskHero AI. The goal is to improve the user experience by making the script more informative and elegant, and to gather necessary setup parameters from the user. The enhanced script will also need to handle the persistence of these parameters so that they are not requested every time the script is run.

Technical Context:

The existing setup_windows.bat script is used to install TaskHero AI and initiate its virtual environment on Windows systems. It currently executes app.py, which starts the TaskHero application. The enhancement should be made keeping in view the existing flow and functionality of the script, while integrating the new features described below.

Key Implementation Considerations:

1. Divide the script into two parts: The first part should install the necessary packages and setup the app requirements. The second part should handle the interactions with the user.

2. User Interaction: The script should ask the user questions regarding the setup, including: 

   - Whether TaskHero will serve as a central repository for all codebases or function within an existing codebase
   - The path of the codebase that TaskHero should index
   - The location of project tasks files storage (either the current folder or /taskherofiles)
   - Whether TaskHero API and MCP functions will be used
   - API details needed for TaskHero to function.

3. Persistence: All the collected details should be stored in the app's settings JSON file and the environment (ENV) file as relevant. If these settings are already present from a previous run, the script should skip the interaction part and proceed directly to run the app.

Expected Deliverables:

1. An enhanced setup_windows.bat script that implements the above considerations.
2. Documentation describing the changes made, how the new script works, and how to use it.

Integration Points:

This task interacts with the existing system at several points:

1. It installs and sets up TaskHero AI and its virtual environment.
2. It interacts with the user to gather necessary setup parameters.
3. It stores these parameters in the app's settings and ENV files as appropriate.
4. It initiates the running of app.py, which starts the TaskHero application.

The enhanced script should maintain compatibility with these existing system components and processes. All changes should be documented and tested to ensure seamless integration.

## 5. UI Design & Specifications
### 5.1. Design Overview
UI design considerations will be defined during implementation phase.

### 5.2. Wireframes & Layout
**Use ASCII art for layouts, wireframes, and component positioning:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Page/Component Layout - Use ASCII art for visual layouts]   │
│ ┌─────────────┐ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ Sidebar     │ │ Main Content Area                       │ │
│ │ - Item 1    │ │ ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐ │ │
│ │ - Item 2    │ │ │ Header/Title Section                │ │ │
│ │ - Item 3    │ │ ├─────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │
│ │             │ │ │ Content Block 1                     │ │ │
│ │             │ │ │ Content Block 2                     │ │ │
│ │             │ │ └─────────────────────────────────────┘ │ │
│ └─────────────┘ └─────────────────────────────────────────┘ │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
**ASCII Art Tips:**
- Use `┌─┐└─┘│├─┤` for clean borders and boxes
- Use `═══` for emphasis/headers
- Use `...` for content areas
- Use `[Button]` for interactive elements
- Use `📊📅💳⚙️` emojis for icons and visual elements
- Use `↕↗▼` arrows for sorting and navigation indicators
- Use `🔴🟢` colored circles for status indicators
- Use `^annotations` below diagrams for explanations

### 5.3. Design System References
- **Colors:** Follow TaskHero AI design system color palette
- **Typography:** Use system default typography standards
- **Spacing:** Follow 8px grid system for consistent spacing
- **Components:** Utilize existing component library where applicable
- **Icons:** Use consistent icon set from design system

### 5.4. Visual Design References

## 6. Risk Assessment
### 6.1. Potential Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Inadequate error handling in the script | High | Medium | Implement comprehensive error handling and logging within the script to capture any exceptions or issues that arise during the installation process. This will allow developers to troubleshoot and resolve issues quickly. |
| User input errors | Medium | High | Validate user input thoroughly to prevent incorrect entries. Provide clear instructions and examples for each input prompt. Implement defaults where appropriate to minimize the amount of input required from the user. |
| Compatibility issues with different Windows versions | Medium | Medium | Test the script across different Windows versions to ensure compatibility. If needed, create different scripts or script versions for different Windows versions. |
| Inadequate documentation leading to incorrect use | Medium | Low | Provide clear, concise, and comprehensive documentation for the script. Include details about its purpose, how to use it, what each section does, and what inputs are expected. |
| Failure to save settings or loss of settings data | High | Low | Implement a robust mechanism for saving and retrieving settings data. This could include data validation, redundancy, and backup measures to prevent data loss. |
