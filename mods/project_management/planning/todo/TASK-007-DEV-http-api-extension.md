# Task: TASK-007 - Extend HTTP API for Task Management

## Metadata
- **Created:** 2025-01-27
- **Due:** 2025-02-12
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Status:** Todo
- **Assigned to:** Developer
- **Task Type:** Development
- **Sequence:** 7
- **Tags:** api, http, integration, rest, endpoints

## Overview
Extend the existing HTTP API to include task management endpoints for external integration and web interfaces. This will enable TaskHero AI to be integrated with other tools and provide a foundation for potential web-based interfaces.

## Implementation Status
| Step | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Design API endpoints | Pending | RESTful design for tasks |
| Implement task CRUD APIs | Pending | Create, Read, Update, Delete |
| Add project management APIs | Pending | Statistics, overviews, reports |
| Create API documentation | Pending | OpenAPI/Swagger specs |
| Add authentication/security | Pending | API keys and rate limiting |

## Detailed Description
Extend the existing HTTP API server to support:
- Task creation, reading, updating, and deletion via REST endpoints
- Project management operations (statistics, reports, bulk operations)
- Kanban board data endpoints for external visualization tools
- Task statistics and reporting APIs for dashboards
- Integration with existing AI endpoints for seamless functionality
- Real-time task updates via WebSocket connections (optional)
- Bulk operations for managing multiple tasks efficiently
- Export/import capabilities for task data

New API endpoints to implement:
- `/api/tasks/` - Task CRUD operations
- `/api/projects/` - Project management operations
- `/api/kanban/` - Kanban board data
- `/api/reports/` - Statistics and reporting
- `/api/templates/` - Template management
- Integration with existing `/api/ask/` and other AI endpoints

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Task management endpoints implemented with full CRUD functionality
- [ ] Project management APIs functional with comprehensive data
- [ ] Kanban board data accessible via API with real-time updates
- [ ] API documentation updated with OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- [ ] Security measures implemented (authentication, rate limiting)
- [ ] Integration with existing endpoints seamless and consistent
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive with proper HTTP status codes
- [ ] API versioning implemented for future compatibility
- [ ] Performance optimized for concurrent requests
- [ ] Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) configured properly

## Implementation Steps
1. Design RESTful API endpoints for task management operations
2. Implement CRUD operations for tasks with proper validation
3. Add project management endpoints for statistics and reports
4. Create API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
5. Add security measures including authentication and rate limiting
6. Test API integration with existing endpoints
7. Implement error handling and proper HTTP status codes
8. Add API versioning for future compatibility
9. Optimize performance for concurrent requests
10. Create integration examples and documentation

## Dependencies
### Required By This Task
- TASK-002 - Develop Core Task Management Module - Todo
- TASK-003 - Implement Kanban Board Visualization - Todo

### Dependent On This Task
- None

## Testing Strategy
- API endpoint testing with various HTTP clients and tools
- Integration testing with existing HTTP API endpoints
- Security and authentication testing with various scenarios
- Performance testing with concurrent requests and large datasets
- Cross-platform testing for API compatibility
- Error handling testing for edge cases and failures
- Load testing to determine capacity and bottlenecks

## Technical Considerations
- Follow REST API best practices and conventions
- Implement proper error handling with meaningful messages
- Consider rate limiting and security measures (API keys, CORS)
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing API
- Design for scalability with future feature additions
- Use proper HTTP status codes and response formats
- Implement API versioning strategy for future changes

## Database Changes
No database changes required - integrates with existing file-based task storage.

## Time Tracking
- **Estimated hours:** 12
- **Actual hours:** TBD
