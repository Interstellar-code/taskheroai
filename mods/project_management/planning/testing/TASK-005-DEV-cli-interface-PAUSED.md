## MAJOR DISCOVERY & RESOLUTION

### **Critical Issue Found:**
During final testing, discovered that the **Project Cleanup Manager** functionality from the original `temp_app.py` was **completely missing** from the new modular architecture.

### **Investigation Results:**
- **Original App (temp_app.py)**: Had comprehensive cleanup functionality as Option 10
- **New Modular App**: Missing this critical feature entirely
- **Root Cause**: Cleanup functionality was not migrated during modularization

### **Solution Implemented:**
1. **Located Original Code**: Found complete cleanup functionality in `temp_app.py:1336-1760`
2. **Adapted for Modular Architecture**: Integrated into `mods/cli/cli_manager.py`
3. **Enhanced Menu**: Added Option 13 to `mods/ui/menu_manager.py`
4. **Full Feature Set Restored**:
   - Delete specific indexed projects
   - Delete multiple projects (batch operation)
   - Delete ALL projects and reset everything (clean slate)
   - Clean up logs and settings only
   - Comprehensive error handling and confirmations

### **Files Modified for Completion:**
1. **`mods/cli/cli_manager.py`** - Added complete cleanup functionality
2. **`mods/ui/menu_manager.py`** - Added Option 13 display
