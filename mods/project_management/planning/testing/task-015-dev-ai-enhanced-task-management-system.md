## Metadata
- **Created:** 2025-05-24
- **Due:** 2025-05-30
- **Priority:** High
- **Status:** Todo
- **Assigned to:** Developer
- **Task Type:** Development
- **Sequence:** 15
- **Tags:** ai, task-management, integration, enhancement
- **Dependencies:** TASK-012, TASK-013
- **Effort Estimate:** 1-2 days

## Overview

## Project Overview
This task addresses the critical need for enhanced AI-powered task creation in TaskHero AI. The current approach of generating task content based solely on titles produces inadequate results that lack depth, context, and actionability.

## Problem Analysis
**Current Issues:**
- Task creation uses only basic title input
- Generated content is generic and template-based
- Missing integration with codebase context
- No collection of detailed requirements
- Poor user experience with limited metadata gathering

**Impact:**
- Tasks lack sufficient detail for effective implementation
- Project management quality is compromised
- Development efficiency is reduced
- Task tracking becomes less meaningful

## Technical Implementation

### Phase 1: Enhanced Metadata Collection
- **Comprehensive Input Gathering**: Collect task type, priority, effort estimates, assignments, dependencies, and tags
- **Validation System**: Ensure all critical metadata is properly captured
- **User Experience**: Provide clear prompts and guidance throughout the process

### Phase 2: Detailed Description Workflow  
- **Multi-line Input**: Allow users to provide comprehensive task descriptions
- **Requirements Capture**: Guide users to include acceptance criteria and technical considerations
- **Context Integration**: Combine user input with system-generated context

### Phase 3: Intelligent Context Search
- **File Indexer Integration**: Search existing codebase for relevant patterns and files
- **Semantic Analysis**: Extract meaningful terms from user descriptions
- **Relevance Scoring**: Prioritize most relevant contextual information

### Phase 4: AI Content Generation Enhancement
- **Comprehensive Context**: Use title + metadata + description + codebase context
- **Structured Output**: Generate detailed implementation plans, acceptance criteria, and technical considerations
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure generated content is actionable and specific

### Phase 5: User Preview and Confirmation
- **Content Preview**: Show users generated content before creation
- **Modification Options**: Allow users to review and adjust before finalizing
- **Quality Feedback**: Provide clear indicators of content quality and completeness

## Implementation Details

   - Improve prompt generation with detailed input
   - Enhance content quality through better context utilization

### Database Schema Changes
- Add `dependencies` field to TaskMetadata
- Add `effort_estimate` field to TaskMetadata  
- Update template processing to include new placeholders
- Enhance task serialization/deserialization

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Metadata Collection**: System collects comprehensive task metadata including type, priority, effort, assignment, dependencies, and tags
- [ ] **Description Input**: Users can provide detailed multi-line task descriptions with requirements and acceptance criteria
- [ ] **Context Search**: System searches indexed files for relevant codebase context using semantic analysis
- [ ] **AI Generation**: AI generates comprehensive content using full context (title + metadata + description + codebase)
- [ ] **User Preview**: Users can preview generated content before task creation with modification options
- [ ] **Enhanced Output**: Generated tasks are significantly more detailed, actionable, and contextually relevant

### Quality Requirements  
- [ ] **Content Quality**: Generated tasks contain detailed implementation plans, acceptance criteria, and technical considerations
- [ ] **Relevance**: AI-generated content accurately reflects user requirements and codebase context
- [ ] **Completeness**: All metadata fields are properly populated and included in task files
- [ ] **User Experience**: Workflow is intuitive with clear progress indicators and helpful prompts

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] **Backward Compatibility**: Enhanced system works with existing task structure and templates
