## Metadata
- **Created:** 2025-01-27
- **Due:** 2025-02-07
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Status:** Todo
- **Assigned to:** Developer
- **Task Type:** Development
- **Sequence:** 5
- **Tags:** cli, interface, user-experience, menu, navigation

## Overview
Enhance the existing CLI interface to include task management features alongside the current AI capabilities. This will provide users with a seamless experience that integrates code analysis and project management in a single, intuitive interface.

## Implementation Status
| Step | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Design new menu structure | Pending | Plan integration of PM features |
| Implement task management commands | Pending | CRUD operations via CLI |
| Add project management options | Pending | Overview, statistics, reporting |
| Create help system | Pending | Comprehensive documentation |
| Integrate with existing UI | Pending | Maintain current AI features |

## Detailed Description
Extend the current VerbalCodeAI menu system to include:
- Task management operations (create, edit, view, delete tasks)
- Project overview and statistics (completion rates, deadlines, workload)
- Kanban board access from the main menu
- Project planning tools (templates, bulk operations)
- Seamless integration with existing AI features
- Enhanced navigation with keyboard shortcuts
- Context-aware help system
- Quick actions and shortcuts for common operations

New menu structure should include:
- Main menu with both AI and Project Management sections
- Sub-menus for task operations, project views, and settings
- Breadcrumb navigation for complex workflows
- Search functionality across tasks and features
- Recent tasks and quick access features

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Enhanced main menu with task management options integrated
- [ ] Task CRUD operations accessible via CLI with proper validation
- [ ] Project overview and statistics display with real-time data
- [ ] Kanban board accessible from CLI with full functionality
- [ ] Help system updated with new features and comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Seamless navigation between AI and PM features
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts implemented for common operations
- [ ] Search functionality working across tasks and features
- [ ] Error handling and user feedback improved
- [ ] Performance optimized for responsive user experience

## Implementation Steps
1. Design new menu structure and user flow diagrams
2. Implement task management CLI commands with proper validation
3. Create project overview displays with statistics and insights
4. Add comprehensive help system with examples and tutorials
5. Integrate with existing terminal UI maintaining consistency
6. Add keyboard shortcuts and quick navigation features
7. Implement search functionality across tasks and features
8. Create context-aware help and suggestions
9. Add bulk operations for managing multiple tasks
10. Optimize performance and responsiveness

## Dependencies
### Required By This Task
- TASK-002 - Develop Core Task Management Module - Todo
- TASK-003 - Implement Kanban Board Visualization - Todo

### Dependent On This Task
- None

## Testing Strategy
- Test all CLI commands and menu options thoroughly
- Verify menu navigation and flow with user scenarios
- Test help system completeness and accuracy
- Validate user experience consistency across features
- Performance testing for responsive interactions
- Accessibility testing for keyboard-only navigation
- Cross-platform testing for terminal compatibility

## Technical Considerations
- Maintain consistency with existing UI patterns and styling

- Consider accessibility features (screen readers, high contrast)
- Implement proper input validation and error handling
- Design for extensibility with future features
- Optimize for performance with large datasets
- Consider internationalization for future expansion

## Database Changes
No database changes required - integrates with existing task file storage.
