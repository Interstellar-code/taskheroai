# TaskHero AI Setup Scripts - Fixes Summary

## 🐛 **Issues Fixed**

### **Primary Issue: Virtual Environment Activation Failure**
The PowerShell setup script (`setup_windows.ps1`) was failing at Step 3 with the error:
```
[ERROR] Failed to activate virtual environment: The module 'venv' could not be loaded.
```

**Root Causes:**
1. **Activation Method**: The script was trying to activate the virtual environment using `& "venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1"` which doesn't work properly in PowerShell scripts
2. **Per-Repository Detection**: The script was checking global setup completion (`.taskhero_setup.json`) but not verifying that the virtual environment actually exists in the current repository directory

### **Secondary Issue: Per-Repository Virtual Environment Detection**
The setup script would show:
```
[SUCCESS] Virtual environment setup already completed - skipping
```
But then fail because the virtual environment didn't exist in the current directory. This happened because:
- Setup completion was tracked globally across all repositories
- The script didn't verify the virtual environment actually exists in the current directory
- Users running setup in different repositories would encounter this mismatch

## 🔧 **Fixes Applied**

### **1. Fixed Per-Repository Virtual Environment Detection**

**Before:**
```powershell
if ($Force -or -not (Test-SetupCompleted "venv_created")) {
    # Only checked global setup completion, not actual venv existence
}
```

**After:**
```powershell
# Always check if virtual environment actually exists in current directory
$venvExists = Test-VirtualEnvironment
$setupCompleted = Test-SetupCompleted "venv_created"

if ($Force -or -not $venvExists) {
    # Create venv if it doesn't exist, regardless of global tracking
} else {
    if ($setupCompleted -and $venvExists) {
        # Both conditions met - skip
    } else {
        # Setup marked complete but venv missing - recreate it
    }
}
```

### **2. Fixed Virtual Environment Activation (`setup_windows.ps1`)**

**Before:**
```powershell
try {
    & "venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1"
    Write-Success "Virtual environment activated"
} catch {
    Write-Error "Failed to activate virtual environment: $_"
    Read-Host "Press Enter to exit"
    exit 1
}
```

**After:**
```powershell
# Check if virtual environment exists
if (-not (Test-Path "venv\Scripts\python.exe")) {
    Write-Error "Virtual environment not found or corrupted"
    Read-Host "Press Enter to exit"
    exit 1
}

# Set environment variables to use the virtual environment
$env:VIRTUAL_ENV = Join-Path $PWD "venv"
$env:PATH = "$env:VIRTUAL_ENV\Scripts;$env:PATH"

# Verify activation by checking Python path
try {
    $pythonPath = & python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)" 2>&1
    if ($pythonPath -like "*venv*") {
        Write-Success "Virtual environment activated successfully"
        Write-Info "Using Python: $pythonPath"
    } else {
        Write-Warning "Virtual environment may not be properly activated"
        Write-Info "Python path: $pythonPath"
    }
} catch {
    Write-Error "Failed to verify virtual environment activation: $_"
    Read-Host "Press Enter to exit"
    exit 1
}
```

### **2. Fixed Dependency Installation**

**Enhanced the `Install-Dependencies` function to:**
- Use the virtual environment Python directly (`venv\Scripts\python.exe`)
- Verify virtual environment exists before attempting installation
- Provide better error handling and feedback

### **3. Fixed Application Launch**

**Enhanced the final app launch to:**
- Use virtual environment Python when available
- Fall back to system Python if needed
- Provide clear feedback about which Python is being used

### **4. Enhanced Standalone Setup Script**

**Improved `standalone_setup_windows.ps1` to:**
- Handle PowerShell execution policies properly
- Use separate PowerShell process for setup script execution
- Provide better error handling and recovery instructions

## 🧪 **Testing & Diagnostics**

### **Integrated Diagnostic Information**
The setup scripts now include built-in diagnostic information that helps troubleshoot virtual environment issues:

**PowerShell Script (`setup_windows.ps1`):**
- Shows virtual environment existence status
- Displays setup completion status
- Shows current directory path
- Provides detailed error messages with recovery suggestions

**Batch Script (`setup_windows.bat`):**
- Shows current directory and expected Python executable path
- Validates virtual environment before using it
- Provides clear feedback about recreation when needed

### **Enhanced Error Messages**
The scripts now provide much more helpful error messages:
- Clear indication of what went wrong
- Specific file paths being checked
- Suggestions for recovery (e.g., "run with -Force")
- Context about per-repository virtual environments

## 📋 **Files Modified**

### **Primary Fixes:**
1. **`setup_windows.ps1`** - Fixed virtual environment activation and dependency installation
2. **`standalone_setup_windows.ps1`** - Enhanced execution policy handling

### **Files Created:**
1. **`standalone_setup_windows.ps1`** - Windows PowerShell standalone setup
2. **`standalone_setup_unix.sh`** - Linux/macOS bash standalone setup
3. **`test_venv_activation.ps1`** - Test script for verification
4. **`STANDALONE_SETUP_README.md`** - Documentation for standalone scripts

### **Files Not Modified (Working Correctly):**
- **`setup_windows.bat`** - Batch script uses correct activation method
- **`setup_linux.sh`** - Linux script works properly

## ✅ **Verification Steps**

### **To test the fixes:**

1. **Test existing installation:**
   ```powershell
   .\test_venv_activation.ps1 -Verbose
   ```

2. **Test standalone setup (new installation):**
   ```powershell
   # Download and run standalone script
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Interstellar-code/taskheroai/master/standalone_setup_windows.ps1" -OutFile "standalone_setup_windows.ps1"
   .\standalone_setup_windows.ps1
   ```

3. **Test fixed main setup:**
   ```powershell
   .\setup_windows.ps1 -Force
   ```

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

After these fixes:
- ✅ Virtual environment activation should work without errors
- ✅ Dependencies should install correctly in the virtual environment
- ✅ TaskHero AI should start using the correct Python environment
- ✅ Standalone setup scripts should work independently
- ✅ All setup processes should complete successfully

## 🔄 **Backward Compatibility**

- ✅ Existing installations will work with the updated scripts
- ✅ The batch script (`setup_windows.bat`) continues to work as before
- ✅ Linux setup script remains unchanged and functional
- ✅ All configuration and settings are preserved

## 📞 **Troubleshooting**

### **If you still encounter issues:**

1. **PowerShell Execution Policy:**
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

2. **Manual Virtual Environment Test:**
   ```powershell
   .\test_venv_activation.ps1
   ```

3. **Force Reinstall:**
   ```powershell
   .\setup_windows.ps1 -Force
   ```

4. **Use Batch Script Alternative:**
   ```cmd
   setup_windows.bat
   ```

The fixes address the core virtual environment activation issue while maintaining compatibility and adding robust error handling throughout the setup process.
