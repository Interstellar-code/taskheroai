- Skip completed configurations on subsequent runs
```

**Low Quality (Score 1-3):**
```python
['The install script must be able to install all necessary packages for the TaskHero AI application to function properly. This should be testable by verifying that the application runs correctly after the script is executed.']
```

### 4. Visual Elements and Diagrams (Weight: 15%)

| 10 | Professional Mermaid diagrams, comprehensive visual elements |
| 8-9 | Good diagrams with minor improvements needed |
| 6-7 | Basic visual elements, some diagrams present |
| 4-5 | Limited visual elements, poor diagram quality |
| 1-3 | No meaningful visual elements or diagrams |

**Visual Element Requirements:**
- [ ] Mermaid flow diagrams for user journeys
